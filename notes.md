# Ideas

- [ ] pivot vs center
- [ ] local vs global
- [ ] multi object transforming
- [ ] different "raycast" origin in VR
- [ ] show little intersection dots in VR
- [ ] better snapping handling
- [ ] have some kind of "bridge" for all input data
  - [ ] head position and rotation
  - [ ] raycast origin position and rotation
  - [ ] activate (like on mouse down)
  - [ ] deactivate (like on mouse up)
  - [ ] snapping (like GetKey(control))
- [ ] events for changes made by the gizmo (maybe also going through the "bridge")
- [ ] snapping indicators for scaling, using another custom shader
- [ ] snapping indicators for moving, using shader

# Todo

- [ ] when looking at the gizmo "from behind?" scaling whole goes in the wrong direction
